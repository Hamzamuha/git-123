            <p> <strong><em>Ethiopia</em></strong>,<sup>[a] </sup>officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, is a landlocked country
                located in the Horn of Africa region of East Africa. It shares borders with Eritrea to the north,
                Djibouti to the northeast, Somalia to the East, Kenya to the South, South Sudan to the West, 
               and Sudan to the Northwest. Ethiopia covers a land area of 1,112,000 square kilometres 
               (472,000 sq. miles).<sup>[14]</sup> As of 2024, it is home to around 132 million inhabitants, making
                it the 10<sup>th</sup>-most populous country in the world,<sup>[15]</sup> the 2<sup>nd</sup>-most populous in Africa after
                Nigeria, and the most populated landlocked country on Earth.<sup>[16][17]</sup> The national capital 
               and largest city, Addis Ababa, lies several kilometres west of the East African Rift that 
               splits the country into the African and Somali tectonic plates.<sup>[18]</sup>
               
               Anatomically modern humans emerged from modern-day Ethiopia and set out for the Near East
                and elsewhere in the Middle Paleolithic period.<sup>[19][20][21][22][23] </sup>Southwestern Ethiopia
                has been proposed as a possible homeland of the Afroasiatic language family.<sup>[24] </sup>In 980 BC,
                the Kingdom of D'mt extended its realm over Eritrea and the northern region of Ethiopia,
                while the Kingdom of Aksum maintained a unified civilization in the region for 900 years. 
               Christianity was embraced by the kingdom in 330,<sup>[25]</sup> and Islam arrived by the first Hijra in 615.[26]
                After the collapse of Aksum in 960, the Zagwe dynasty ruled the north-central parts of Ethiopia
                until being overthrown by Yekuno Amlak in 1270, inaugurating the Ethiopian Empire and the 
               Solomonic dynasty, claimed descent from the biblical Solomon and Queen of Sheba under their
                son Menelik I. By the 14th century, the empire had grown in prestige through territorial
                expansion and fighting against adjacent territories; most notably, the Ethiopian–Adal War
                (1529–1543) contributed to fragmentation of the empire, which ultimately fell under a
                decentralization known as Zemene Mesafint in the mid-18th century. 
               Emperor Tewodros II ended Zemene Mesafint at the beginning of his reign in 1855, marking 
               the reunification and modernization of Ethiopia.<sup>[27]</sup><br><br>

            <p>  <strong>South Africa</strong>, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost 
                country in Africa. Its nine provinces are bounded to the south by 2,798 kilometres
                 (1,739 miles) of coastline that stretches along the South Atlantic and Indian
                 Ocean;<sup>[14][15][16]</sup> to the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana, 
                and Zimbabwe; and to the east and northeast by Mozambique and Eswatini. It also 
                enclaves Lesotho.<sup>[17]</sup> It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old
                 World and the second-most populous country located entirely south of the equator,
                 after Tanzania. With over 62 million people, the country is the world's 23<sup>rd</sup>-most 
                populous nation and the 24<sup>th</sup>-largest country in the world, covering an area of 1,221,037 
                square kilometres (471,445 square miles). Pretoria is the administrative capital, while
                 Cape Town, as the seat of Parliament, is the legislative capital. Bloemfontein has 
                traditionally been regarded as the judicial capital.<sup>[18]</sup> The largest and most-populous 
                city is Johannesburg, followed by Cape Town and the largest port city in sub-Saharan Africa, Durban.
                
                Archaeological findings suggest that various hominid species existed in South Africa 
                about 2.5 million years ago and modern humans inhabited the region over 100,000 years ago.
                 The first known people were the indigenous Khoisan, and Bantu-speaking peoples from West 
                and Central Africa later settled in the region in the early centuries CE(i.e.2000 years). 
                In 1652, the Dutch established the first European settlement at Table Bay, and in 1795 and 1806,
                 the British occupied it. Diamonds and gold were discovered in the 19th century, bringing
                 a shift towards industrialisation and urbanisation. The Union of South Africa was created
                 in 1910 out of the former Cape, Natal, Transvaal, and Orange River colonies. Though a system 
                of non-racial franchise had existed in the Cape, it was gradually eroded, and the vast majority 
                of Black South Africans were not enfranchised until 1994. During the 20th century, the black 
                majority sought to claim more rights from the dominant white minority, which played a large
                 role in the country's recent history and politics. The National Party imposed apartheid in 1948, 
                institutionalising previous racial segregation. After a largely non-violent struggle by the
                 African National Congress and other anti-apartheid activists both inside and outside the country,
                 the repeal of discriminatory laws began in the mid-1980s. Universal elections took place in 1994,
                 following which, all racial groups have held political representation in the country's
                 liberal democracy, which comprises a parliamentary republic and nine provinces.
                 According to the V-Dem Democracy Indices, it is ranked the 53rd electoral democracy
                 worldwide and the third in Africa.<sup>[19] </sup><br><br>

            <p> <strong>Kenya</strong>, officially the Republic of Kenya (Swahili: Jamhuri ya Kenya), is a country in 
                East Africa. With a population of more than 47.6 million in the 2019 census,<sup>[12]</sup> Kenya 
                is the 28<sup>th</sup>-most-populous country in the world<sup>[7]</sup> and 7th most populous in Africa.
                 Kenya's capital and largest city is Nairobi, while its oldest and second-largest city,
                 is the major port city of Mombasa, situated on Mombasa Island in the Indian Ocean and 
                the surrounding mainland. Mombasa was the capital of the British East Africa Protectorate,
                 which included most of what is now Kenya and southwestern Somalia, from 1889 to 1907.
                 Other important cities include Kisumu and Nakuru. Kenya is bordered by <strong>South Sudan</strong> to 
                the northwest, <strong>Ethiopia</strong> to the north, <strong>Somalia</strong> to the east, <strong>Uganda</strong> to the west, <strong>Tanzania</strong>
                 to the south, and the <strong>Indian Ocean </strong>to the southeast. Kenya's geography, climate and 
                population vary widely, ranging from cold snow-capped mountaintops (Batian, Nelion and Point
                 Lenana on Mount Kenya) with vast surrounding forests, wildlife and fertile agricultural
                 regions to temperate climates in western and rift valley counties and further on to dry less
                 fertile arid and semi-arid areas and absolute deserts (Chalbi Desert and Nyiri Desert).
                
                Kenya's earliest inhabitants were hunter-gatherers, like the present-day Hadza people.<sup>[13][14]</sup>
                 According to archaeological dating of associated artifacts and skeletal material, 
                Cushitic speakers first settled in Kenya's lowlands between 3,200 and 1,300 BC,
                 a phase known as the Lowland Savanna Pastoral Neolithic. Nilotic-speaking pastoralists 
                (ancestral to Kenya's Nilotic speakers) began migrating from present-day South Sudan 
                into Kenya around 500 BC.<sup>[15]</sup> Bantu people settled at the coast and the interior
                 between 250 BC and 500 AD.<sup>[16]</sup>
                
                European contact began in 1500 AD with the Portuguese Empire, and effective colonisation of 
                Kenya began in the 19th century during the European exploration of Africa. Modern-day Kenya 
                emerged from a protectorate established by the British Empire in 1895 and the subsequent Kenya
                 Colony, which began in 1920. Numerous disputes between the UK and the colony led to the 
                Mau Mau revolution, which began in 1952, and the declaration of independence in 1963. 
                After independence, Kenya remained a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The current 
                constitution was adopted in 2010 and replaced the 1963 independence constitution. <br><br>
